# Build Your Own X Where X = Promise

A `Promise` represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. Perhaps you already know what it is, or even have used it quite frequently. But if not, I hope these references help:

- [JavaScript Promises: an Introduction](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises) (Google Developers Web Fundamentals)
- [Using promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises) (MDN)

I'm not going to make another tutorial about how to use promises, so just make it straight into the subject: I'm going to implement a `Promise` compliant with the [Promise/A+](https://promisesaplus.com/) Standard.

Proudly adopted Azogi naming, my first `Promise` implementation is named `Phisofa`.

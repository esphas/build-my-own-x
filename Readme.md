> What I cannot create, I do not understand.

**Build My Own X** is an attempt to learn, understand and share thoughts about **X** by building it from scratch.

This project is motivated by [Build Your Own X](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x) and [Learn X in Y minutes](https://github.com/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs). The former is a collection of varieties of blogs, tutorials, and code samples showing how to create certain types of applications, while the later is a collection of single-page code samples teaching basics of specific programming languages.
